                <p>
                    Miguel Urrego was born Colombia. He moved to the USA with his family when he was 7 years old. As a child he always expressed interest in art and architecture. 
                    Growing up, he loved to discover new tools and techniques to develop his artistic skills. His main artistic interest includes urban landscaping art with micron pens on Bristol paper. 
                    Most of his artwork depicts historical architecture, such as the streets of Villa de Leyva. In the past years he has started experimenting with abstract art and touches of color. 
                    He enjoys attending art galleries and submitting his art pieces to local contests.

                    The main techniques found in Urban Trazos pieces are fine line micron pens on bristol paper.
                    Close attention to detail and measuremnents are of upmost importance. 
                    Likewise, perspective plays a massive part in these artworks. 
            </p>
            <p class="midp">
                Urban Trazos pieces are not just limited to fine line ink on paper. The artist explores with other medias, such as markers, abstracts color, clay, stamping. 
                Fun fact: the logo is a stamp created by the artist.
